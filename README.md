Hi there!

I'm **MrArCode** (or **Mr A** – whichever sounds better to you).

For most of my life, I've been passionate about computer games, human languages, and history. Recently, programming joined the party, and I've been completely hooked ever since. I love building things from scratch, understanding every part of the software that surrounds me, and diving deep into how things actually work under the hood.

I'm deeply committed to **Java** (the most elegantly verbose language). My second choice is **C#** – Java's prettier sister – and I'm also learning **C++** to look smart enough during job applications.

Find me in the digital void!
